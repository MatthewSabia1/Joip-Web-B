# Joip AI - Project State (2024-08-07)

This document provides an analysis of the Joip AI web application's architecture, technology stack, and current development state. It is updated periodically as development progresses.

## Changelog

*   **2024-08-09:** Fixed infinite loop bug in Reddit refresh token mechanism. Implemented a refresh token attempt tracking system to prevent continuous failed requests when the Reddit API returns errors. This prevents browser freezing and excessive API calls.
*   **2024-08-09:** Fixed Reddit authentication persistence. Refactored `RedditAuthContext` to proactively initialize the session using stored refresh tokens on load, centralized token refresh logic, and ensured state is correctly saved/loaded via `useUserSettings`.
*   **2024-08-09:** Fixed slideshow transitions breaking after the first item. Synchronized animation durations between `useSlideshow` hook and `MediaDisplay` component CSS. Refactored transition timing logic in `useSlideshow` to correctly sequence state updates (`isTransitioning`, `currentIndex`) with animation completion.
*   **2024-08-09:** Fixed final TypeScript build error (TS2322) by removing unused props (`currentIndex`, `onNext`, `onPrevious`) from the `MediaDisplay` component invocation in `App.tsx`.
*   **2024-08-09:** Fixed TypeScript build error (TS6133) by removing unused imports, props, and variables from `MediaDisplay.tsx`.
*   **2024-08-09:** Enhanced slideshow transition animations with smoother effects. Improved CSS transforms, added proper enter/exit animations, implemented effect-specific timing, and fixed bugs with concurrent transitions. All transitions (fade, slide, zoom, flip) now appear more polished and professional.
*   **2024-08-09:** Improved Reddit media display with multi-stage fallback system that handles failed media loads. Added URL transformations to fix preview.redd.it URLs, implemented retry functionality, and improved display for unavailable media.
*   **2024-08-08:** Enhanced Reddit media loading with multiple fallback methods, removed NSFW badges as requested, and added more robust debugging options for media playback issues. Implemented direct URL fallbacks and improved CORS handling.
*   **2024-08-08:** Fixed Reddit media display issues by implementing robust media URL extraction and processing. Added fallbacks for failed media loading, improved CORS handling, and added proper NSFW content support. Also added a Debug tab in Settings for troubleshooting.
*   **2024-08-07:** Fixed OAuth history state security errors by improving URL cleanup in RedditAuthContext and PatreonAuthContext. Implemented image proxy solution for Reddit images to fix CORS issues in local development.
*   **2024-08-07:** Fixed "Missing authorization header" errors in Patreon and Reddit OAuth flows by ensuring the correct tokens (user JWT for Patreon connect, Supabase anon key for Reddit refresh) are passed in the `Authorization` header of frontend requests to Supabase Edge Functions.
*   **YYYY-MM-DD:** Initial deep dive analysis and documentation creation.
*   **YYYY-MM-DD:** Removed verbose `console.log` statements from `App.tsx`, `RedditAuthContext.tsx`, and `useRedditPosts.ts`. Updated document title and added changelog.

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 Frontend Architecture

*   **Entry Point:** `src/main.tsx` initializes React and renders `src/App.tsx`.
*   **Routing:** `src/App.tsx` defines routes using `react-router-dom`:
    *   `/`: Main application view (`MainApp` component).
    *   `/login`: User login page (`LoginPage`).
    *   `/register`: User registration page (`RegisterPage`).
    *   `/settings`: User settings page (`SettingsPage`).
*   **Main Application Layout (`MainApp`):**
    *   Resizable panels display Reddit media (`MediaDisplay`) and AI captions (`CaptionDisplay`).
    *   Header contains navigation, theme toggle, and user avatar/auth status.
*   **State Management & Data Flow:**
    *   **Authentication:** `AuthContext` manages Supabase user sessions and profiles. `RedditAuthContext` manages Reddit OAuth tokens, storing them in user settings via `useUserSettings`.
    *   **User Settings:** `useUserSettings` hook manages preferences (subreddits, API keys, etc.), syncing between local storage and the Supabase DB (`user_settings` table).
    *   **Reddit Data:** `useRedditPosts` hook fetches posts using the Reddit OAuth API (requires Reddit auth via `RedditAuthContext`).
    *   **Slideshow Logic:** `useSlideshow` hook manages the display cycle of posts fetched by `useRedditPosts`.
    *   **AI Captions:** `useAICaption` hook uses the current post and user settings (API key, prompt) to generate captions via OpenRouter.
*   **Key Components:** Located in `src/components/`. UI primitives via `src/components/ui/`.
*   **Key Hooks:** Located in `src/hooks/`. Encapsulate major functionalities.
*   **Key Contexts:** Located in `src/contexts/`. Manage global state (Auth, Reddit Auth).

### 3.2 Backend Architecture (Supabase)

*   **Database:** PostgreSQL managed by Supabase.
    *   **Schema:** Managed via SQL migrations in `supabase/migrations/`.
    *   **Key Tables (Inferred):**
        *   `auth.users` (Built-in)
        *   `profiles` (Public schema: `id` (FK to auth.users), `username`, `avatar_url`, etc.)
        *   `user_settings` (Public schema: `user_id` (FK to auth.users, unique), `preferences` (JSONB containing subreddits, interval, keys, redditAuth tokens, etc.))
*   **Authentication:** Utilizes Supabase Auth for email/password and integrates with Reddit/Patreon OAuth providers via Edge Functions.
*   **Edge Functions (`supabase/functions/`):**
    *   `reddit-auth`: Handles Reddit OAuth callback (`/callback`) and token refresh (`/refresh`). Requires `VITE_REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` and `VITE_REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET`.
    *   `patreon-auth`: Handles Patreon OAuth callback. Requires client ID/secret configuration within the function code.
    *   `_shared`: Likely contains shared utilities for functions.
*   **Storage:** Supabase Storage used for user avatars (`avatars` bucket).

## 4. Current State & Functionality

*   **Core Feature:** Displays Reddit media slideshows with AI captions.
*   **User Accounts:** Supports email/password registration and login.
*   **Reddit Integration:** Users can connect their Reddit accounts via OAuth to fetch content from private/subscribed subreddits (using `history` and `mysubreddits` scopes). Fetches top posts weekly.
*   **Patreon Integration:** Authentication flow exists but its purpose within the app isn't immediately clear from the code examined (likely for premium features or creator support).
*   **AI Captions:** Generates captions using OpenRouter based on post details and a user-configurable system prompt. Requires an OpenRouter API key.
*   **User Settings:** Users can configure:
    *   Target subreddits.
    *   Slideshow interval and transition effect.
    *   AI system prompt.
    *   OpenRouter API key.
*   **Customization:** Supports light/dark theme toggling.
*   **Persistence:** User settings and Reddit auth tokens are persisted in the Supabase database for logged-in users and cached in local storage.

## 5. Setup & Deployment

*   **Local Development:** Requires Node.js/npm, a `.env` file with Supabase/Reddit credentials, and running `npm install && npm run dev`. Supabase local development (`supabase start`) might be needed for full testing.
*   **Deployment:** Configured for Netlify. Requires environment variables for Supabase URL/key and Reddit client ID/secret. Supabase Edge Functions must be deployed separately (`supabase functions deploy`).

## 6. Potential Areas for Review/Improvement

*   **Error Handling & User Feedback:** Ensure errors from API calls (Reddit, OpenRouter, Supabase) are consistently handled and communicated clearly to the user, beyond console logs.
*   **Loading States:** Verify clear and consistent loading indicators for all asynchronous operations.
*   **Reddit API Usage:** Monitor efficiency if users add many subreddits. Explore alternative endpoints if needed (e.g., fetching from multiple subreddits in one call if possible, using different sorting/timeframes).
*   **AI Cost/Rate Limits:** OpenRouter usage incurs costs. Implement checks or limits if necessary. Handle rate limits gracefully.
*   **Patreon Flow:** Clarify the purpose and integration of Patreon authentication if it's a core feature.
*   **Code Cleanup:** ~~Minor TODOs or console logs might exist from development.~~ (Verbose console logs removed YYYY-MM-DD).
*   **Testing:** No automated tests were observed. Consider adding unit/integration tests for key hooks and components.

## Project State
